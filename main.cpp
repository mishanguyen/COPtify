/* This program implements a basic version of a Spotify-like music streaming service. 
It allows a user to create an account with a name and email and manage a playlist. 
The playlist has a list of songs, represented by the Song class, which includes information such as the song name, artist, album name, and duration. 
The Playlist class supplies methods to manage the playlist, such as add a song, play, play next or previous, and so on. 
The User class allows to create a user and holds name and email of the user. 
The program allows the user to interact with the system and manage the playlist of songs, simulating the basic functionality of a music streaming service. 
Note that the classes are templated but should be of type Song defined in classSong.hpp*/
